## **Vulnerability Assessment Report**


### **1<sup>st</sup> September 2023**


---


## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.


## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.


## Purpose

The database server is regularly used by employees of the company to find potential customers. It is a remote database server since many of the employees work remotely from locations around the world. It is critical to secure the system because of its regular use for marketing operations. Keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability and it would be detrimental to the business if it were disabled.

## Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs. Since the database server is open to the public, the attack surface offers many threat sources. Threat sources with malicious intent pose significant business risks.


## Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
